[Marvel Opening Credits]

[radio transmission sound]

[Asgardian PA]: This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman! We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault – The engines are dead, life support failing! Requesting aid from any vessel within range... We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here! This is not a war craft, I repeat, this is not a war craft!

[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. He steps over them as he speaks with no mind, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

[Loki is seen with the Black Order. He watches Thanos.]

Thanos: [Looking out the large window.] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [grabs Thor by the head.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.

[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the Power Stone.]

Thor: [exhaustedly spitting blood from his mouth] You talk too much.

Thanos: [to Loki] the Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.

Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!

[Thanos sets the gauntlet on Thor's face. The red ring glows brightly. Thor suffers in pain.]

Loki: [cringing and looking away from his brother's pain and has just thought for a few seconds] ALRIGHT, STOP!

Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.

[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. he lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself]

Thor: You really are the worst, brother.

Loki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother, the Sun will shine on us again.

Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Loki: Well, for one thing: I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.

[Loki dives out of the way as The Hulk emerges and fights Thanos. Punches are exchanged and Thanos is forced into the wall of the ship. Ebony Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]

Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.

[Thanos defeats Hulk and dumps him to the ground. Thor tries to interfere but Ebony Maw binds him to the ground.]

Heimdall: Allfathers... let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.

[Heimdall summons the Doorway, which carries Hulk away.]

Thanos: That was a mistake.

[Thanos stabs Heimdall through the heart.]

Thor: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! You're going to die for that!

[Ebony Maw shuts Thor's mouth]

Ebony Maw: Shhhh. [Holding the Tesseract, on one knee] My humble personage... bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.

[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the Space Stone. He places it on the infinity gauntlet.]

Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Knowhere.

Corvus Glaive: Father, we will not fail you.

Loki: [Emerging from a separate section of the ship] If I might, interject... If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

Thanos: If you consider failure experience...

Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos. I, Loki, Heir to Asgard... Frost Giant... The rightful Soldier of Asgard, do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.

[Ebony Maw squints and notices a dagger in Loki's hand. Loki attempts to stab Thanos, but fails.]

Thanos: “Undying.” You should choose your words more carefully.

[Thanos tightens his hold around Loki's neck. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]

Loki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You... will never be... a god. [Thanos snaps Loki's neck, killing him]

Thanos: No resurrections this time.

[Thanos teleports away with the Black Order.]

Thor: No... Loki...

[Thor is released from his binds. He crawls over to Loki's body- which, unlike in the Dark World, has not returned to its Asgardian form - and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes. The Doorway sends Hulk across space to Earth.]
